# peon-ping-toggle

Toggle peon-ping sounds on or off.

Run the following command using the Bash tool:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/peon.sh --toggle
```

Report the output to the user. The command will print either:
- `peon-ping: sounds paused` — sounds are now muted
- `peon-ping: sounds resumed` — sounds are now active
